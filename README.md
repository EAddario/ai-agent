# AI Agent

AI Agent is proof of concept for autonomous agentic AI built with TypeScript. It integrates multiple tools such as fetching Reddit posts, telling jokes, searching for movies, and retrieving user-specific information like IP address and location. The AI agent processes user inputs, and decides to use the appropriate tool based on the context.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** Understands and responds to user queries using the chosen AI model.
- **Integrated Tools:**
  - **Reddit Fetching:** Retrieves top posts from Reddit.
  - **Joke Telling:** Provides Dad jokes and Chuck Norris jokes.
  - **Movie Search:** Searches for movies based on various filters.
  - **User Information:** Fetches user's IP address and geographical location.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add or modify tools to extend functionality.
- **Memory Management:** Maintains conversation history and summarizes past interactions to preserve context size.
- **Approval Workflow:** Ensures user consent before executing certain tools.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 16.x or higher
- **npm:** Package manager for installing dependencies
- **Upstash Account:** For vector indexing (optional, required only for movie search functionality). If you'd like to use a different vector database ([Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) or [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) are excellent choices), please modify `./src/rag/query.ts` and `./src/rag/ingest.ts`.
- **AI Provider API Key:** An API Key from an OpenAI compatible provider (e.g. OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc.) is required. The chosen AI model **must** support tool/function calls. For example, [watt-ai/watt-tool-70B](https://huggingface.co/watt-ai/watt-tool-70B), OpenAI's [ChatGPT o4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/), [Gemini 2.0 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EAddario/ai-agent.git
   cd ai-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```env
   # OpenAI Configuration
   AI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   AI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4
   ```

2. The movie tool uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and a valid [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account is required. Once your have configured the vector database (instructions below), please add the endpoint URL and TOKEN to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=https://your-upstash-url
   UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-token
   ```
   Instructions how to set up the vector database are beyond the scope of this README, but a guide is available at [Upstash: Getting Sterated](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/getstarted). Once the database is configured, please execute `npm run ingest` to populate it with the movie data.
   
## Usage

Run the AI Agent by providing a message as a command-line argument. The agent will process the input, utilize the necessary tools, and provide a response. A record of all interactions is stored in `db.json`

```bash
npm start "<user message>"
```

### Example
(using google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free)
